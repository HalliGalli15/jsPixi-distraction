# jsPixi-distraction

This is just a little repository to store my progress of my JS-game attempts and to share it with others. I'm trying to learn JS-Game developement for future GameJams or private projects. 
Don't expect anything fancy or planned, beside even structured.

# Run / Build
To run this project you simply need to set up a Web-Server and put it on... that's all :)
